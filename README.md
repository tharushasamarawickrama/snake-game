# snake-game
This project is a Simple Snake Game implemented using Python and Pygame. The game features a snake that moves continuously in one of four directions (up, down, left, or right) and grows in length whenever it eats an apple. The objective is to keep the snake alive as long as possible while collecting apples to increase the score.
